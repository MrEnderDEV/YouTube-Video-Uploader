# Stekeblad's Youtube Uploader
## Easier bulk uploads to YouTube
Helps people who upload a lot of videos to YouTube by automatically
setting video title, description, tags, playlist,
category, ... the user saves a lot of monotone work.

With Stekeblad's Youtube Uploader you can first create a "preset"
that is a predefined and reusable set of video details, like the default
tags on youtube, but with more settings and you can create several of them.
After that you select the files to upload, a preset to apply and press upload.
Now you just need to wait for the uploads to finish. No more editing the
video details for all videos one at a time on Youtube's upload page!

(You can still edit the videos one at a time if you want to)

Because playlist in the second preset in the image above is "null" the
description of the videos in the image below has no playlist url
