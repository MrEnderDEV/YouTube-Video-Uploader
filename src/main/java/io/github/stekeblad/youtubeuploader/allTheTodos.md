# A list to remember things that can be done but i cant do because I am working on another part of the program at the moment

### \#LongTitle

And suddenly all my ideas just vanished...

#### Right now
- Working on how both presets and videos to be uploaded should be
edited and deleted from their lists
- javafx based concurrency

#### More important things to do

- Selecting files and a preset makes it possible to add files to upload list and after
that make files uploadable


#### Less important things to do
- Creating localization support and moving all strings visible for the users there (resourceBundle)
- Then getting playlists, get ALL, not just the 25 first. Make playlists searchable

#### Thinking
- is presetName needed in VideoPreset? is it not equal to paneId?
