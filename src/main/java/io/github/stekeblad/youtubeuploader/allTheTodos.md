# A list to remember things that can be done but i cant do because I am working on another part of the program at the moment

### \#LongTitle

And suddenly all my ideas just vanished...

- RxJava to async uploads (if needed) ((probably not needed))
- Get the users playlists and show dropdown instead of asking for playlist URL, URL NOT SUPPORTED IN API!
- Finish load and save of presets (only playlist left)

-- playlist to/from file for testing without network request, do not really understand response format yet

-- playlist choicebox
