- MVP pattern or similar
- Dagger injection? ConfigManager?
- RxJava to async uploads (if needed)
- GSON to save settings to files as JSON
- each pane in PaneFactory is its own class? extend-ing videoDetails for preset and upload
- Get the users playlists and show dropdown instead of asking for playlist URL
