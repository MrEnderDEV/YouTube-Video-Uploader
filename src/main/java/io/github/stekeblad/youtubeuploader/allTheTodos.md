# A list to remember things that can be done but i cant do because I am working on another part of the program at the moment

### \#LongTitle

And suddenly all my ideas just vanished...

#### Right now
- Categories should be downloaded for the user's location instead of the
categories for my location being hardcoded
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements
- Bugs and small things

#### More important things to do

- handle network errors (wait a short time and try to continue the upload
without restarting from the beginning)


#### Less important things to do
- Creating localization support and moving all strings visible for the users there (resourceBundle)
- Then getting playlists, get ALL, not just the 25 first. Make playlists searchable
- warn then trying to close preset/settings window while presets are being edited
