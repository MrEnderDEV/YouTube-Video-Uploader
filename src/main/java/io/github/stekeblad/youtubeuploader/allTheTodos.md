# A list to remember things that can be done but i cant do because I am working on another part of the program at the moment

### \#LongTitle

And suddenly all my ideas just vanished...

- MVP pattern or similar (I have what I have now, will I redo it..?)
- Dagger injection? ConfigManager?
- RxJava to async uploads (if needed) ((probably not needed))
- Get the users playlists and show dropdown instead of asking for playlist URL, URL NOT SUPPORTED IN API!
- Finish load and save of presets
