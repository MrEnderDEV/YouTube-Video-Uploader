# A list to remember things that can be done but i cant do because I am working on another part of the program at the moment

### \#LongTitle

And suddenly all my ideas just vanished...

- RxJava to async uploads (if needed) ((probably not needed)) and for getting playlists (needed)
- ~~Move stuff to PresetManager~~ configManager will manage presets in string form
- Selecting files and a preset makes it possible to add files to upload list and after
that make files uploadable
- Add support for syncing playlists with youtube after first load (just button missing to call method)
