# A list to remember things that can be done but i cant do because I am working on another part of the program at the moment

### \#LongTitle

And suddenly all my ideas just vanished...

#### Right now
- javafx based concurrency
- Close program and continue upload later
- Remove abort button then finished uploading
- is progressbar moving?
- can Uploader tell me in some way if it is uploading something at a specific moment
or if it is not?

#### More important things to do

- Selecting files and a preset makes it possible to add files to upload list and after
that make files uploadable


#### Less important things to do
- Creating localization support and moving all strings visible for the users there (resourceBundle)
- Then getting playlists, get ALL, not just the 25 first. Make playlists searchable
- Categories should be downloaded for the usser's location instead of the categories for my location being hardcoded
