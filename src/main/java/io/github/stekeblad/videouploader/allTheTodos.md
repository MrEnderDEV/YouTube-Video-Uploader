# What I am working on and planning on maybe doing in the future

#### Right now
- Recording videos on how to get and use the program.
    - Add it to readme
    - Add it to wiki home page
    - pick images from the videos and add to readme + wiki
- Bugs and small things

#### More important things to do
- none now


#### Less important things to do
- Creating localization support and moving all strings visible for the users there (resourceBundle)
- Then getting playlists, get ALL, not just the 25 first. Filter playlists
to appear in choiceBox and maybe also create new inside program
- warn then trying to close preset/settings window while presets are being edited
- confirmation on abort
