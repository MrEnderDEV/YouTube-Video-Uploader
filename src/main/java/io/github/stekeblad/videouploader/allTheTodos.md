# What I am working on and planning on maybe doing in the future

#### Right now
- Bugs and small things

#### Higher priority things to do
- Change "Abort all and clear" button to not affect started uploads.
users can currently not remove all not started at once and it would
only be two extra click to first abort all before clearing.

#### Lower priority things to do
- Creating localization support and moving all strings visible for the
users there (resourceBundle)
- add notice for that Edge does not work for authentication!
(where? In all dialogs...?)

#### Thinking about
- Keep even unstarted uploads on close?
