# What I am working on and planning on maybe doing in the future

#### Right now
- Get better images and add to readme + wiki + my gh-pages
- Bugs and small things
- add notice for that Edge does not work for authentication!
(where? In all dialogs...?)

#### More important things to do
- Nothing prevents a preset to be created with or renamed to the same name as
another preset and overwriting the old one.
- Then getting playlists, get ALL, not just the 25 first. Filter playlists
to appear in choiceBox and maybe also create new inside program

#### Less important things to do
- Creating localization support and moving all strings visible for the users there (resourceBundle)
- warn then trying to close preset/settings window while presets are being edited

#### Thinking about
- Keep even unstarted uploads on close?
- add Constant ApplicationName to use instead of hardcoded string
