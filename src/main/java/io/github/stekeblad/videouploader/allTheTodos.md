# What I am working on and planning on maybe doing in the future

#### Right now
- Recording videos on how to get and use the program.
    - Add it to readme
    - Add it to wiki home page
    - add to the stekeblad.github.io pages
    - pick images from the videos and add to readme + wiki
- Bugs and small things
- add notice for that Edge does not work for authentication!

#### More important things to do
- Nothing prevents a preset to be created with or renamed to the same name as
another preset and overwriting the old one.


#### Less important things to do
- Creating localization support and moving all strings visible for the users there (resourceBundle)
- Then getting playlists, get ALL, not just the 25 first. Filter playlists
to appear in choiceBox and maybe also create new inside program
- warn then trying to close preset/settings window while presets are being edited
- confirmation on abort
- add Constant ApplicationName to use instead of hardcoded string
- Can the Builder classes in VideoPreset and VideoUpload inherit from
the one in VideoInformationBase?
- Moving the set text and set progress code in Uploader.java to VideoUploader.java
